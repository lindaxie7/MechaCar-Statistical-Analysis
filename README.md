# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. We are going to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance. The two variables that had the most amount of random variance are ground_clearance and vehicle_length

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, because the p value is 5.35e-11, it is very small, there is a significant linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable 

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, based on the summary and the plot, we can conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, it is predict effectively.
